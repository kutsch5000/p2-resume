			<ul>
				<li><h3>Spokane Mercury Athletic Club</h3>
					<p>At this job I was a volunteer distance coach for Spokane Mercury during both the track and cross country season. I learned to collaborate well with my fellow coaches in order to determine how to make the kids perform at their best each day. On any given day there were 20-50 kids that I had to help with. This taught me how to work well with my coworkers as well as staying calm in stressful situations. It also taught me how to work well with kids of all ages in an encouraging manner.</p></li>
				<li><h3>SYSA</h3>
					<p>As a soccer referee I learned many valuable skills. The most helpful being, how to handle unhappy parents. As it pertains to a job at Runner’s Soul this skill can be used to handle customers and make sure they leave the store happy.</p></li>
				<li><h3>Zak! Designs</h3>
					<p>As a worker on the production line at Zak! Designs I gained a lot of skills that will be very helpful working at Runner’s Soul. Some of the skills I learned were, organization and how to work well in a team setting. Working the production line at Zak! Designs it was essential to keep organized in order to work efficiently. At any given time there were as many as ten jobs lined up and if we weren’t organized and didn’t work well as a team we would get behind really quick. So, staying organized and working as a team were essential.</p></li>
